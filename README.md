# Progressive Web App Template

This code provides a working template for the development of modern Progressive Web App that needs to be connected to a running instance of the **Rest API Template**.

It only runs on Codio boxes.

To install, run the following command from inside the Codio box:

```
$ curl -sL https://bit.ly/3kZ56Kd | sudo -E bash -
```

> Note this will delete ALL the existing content from your Codio Box.

The server will start when you open the terminal. If you need to start the server manually, run the following command:

```shell
$ http-server
  Starting up http-server, serving ./
  Available on:
    http://127.0.0.1:8080
    http://10.177.160.215:8080
  Hit CTRL-C to stop the server
```
